## Project on American Sign Language Letter Recognition with autocorrection and auto complete features

## PyTorch

The project is base code of a translation application for translating American Sign Language snapshots to Engligh characters. The project is built on PyTorch and is trained on 87,000 200x200 pixels images. There are 29 classes, of which 26 are for the letters A-Z and 3 classes for SPACE, DELETE and NOTHING. These 3 non alphabetical classes are very helpful in real time translation applications. The test data set contains a mere 29 images, to encourage the use of real world test images. Dataset can be downloaded from [Kaggle] (https://www.kaggle.com/grassknoted/asl-alphabet).

Since the images in training dataset do not have much variation, data augmentation is used to introduce variance in the training image. A number of data augmentation techniques are used, namely
    * Horizontal Flip
    * Horizontal Flip and Vertical Flip
    * Horizontal Flip and Color Jitter
    * Horizontal Flip and Grey Scale
    * Horizontal Flip and Shear

The architecture consists of AlexNet classifier which classifies images to corresponding alphabets and produces a string as output. The classifier is augmented by RNN which intakes the string generated by classifier and autocorrects and autocompletes the phrase or sentence.
